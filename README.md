a)in models package, there is a User model
b)in dao package - working with database by Hibernate. I could use Spring Data Jpa)
c)in init package - configuration files
d)validator - there is a check data , you can't put empty data to the fields, you can't type to the phone field some wrong information
To start this project - you need to type into command line - mvn clean && install 
                                                            mvn jetty:run
                                                            
then you need to open your browser at http://localhost:8080/web-advanced/
